    "### Part 1 - Better Chronology\n",
    "In order to get a better chronology or establish a strong age model for paleorecords pertaining to termination II, the last paper (Marino et al 2015) we have read in class is actually a good case study for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to have independent radiometrically dated records and then compare those records on a single consistent time-scale. \n",
    "2. We have to compare apples with apples. A good example is how Marino et al 2015 tuned their N. pachyderma record with another radiometrically dated N. pachyderma record and built on the assumption that these two records were exposed to the same environments (makes them comparable). So that when we 'wiggle-match\", we know we are wiggle-matching similar records and are not introducing biases to the tuning process.\n",
    "3. Probably better off to establish the chronology independent of orbital forcing or not tune these records to orbital forcing. Otherwise you will be more biased and immediately assume that there is some orbital forcing in the record.\n",
    "4. Marino et al 2015 also did well in terms of clarifying the limitations and assumptions in their age model. They gave an extensive explanation on the reasons why they chose certain proxies and the mechanisms driving the variability in their record.\n",
    "5. They took a conservative approach to their tie-point matching and tuning. \n",
